# Problem
We want to be able to visualize and understand the audio analysis from different songs.

# Questions
1. What is its value in analyzing audio?
2. How does the FFT work?
3. How can we use the FFT for implementing an audio analysis visualizaion?

### 1. Mini-abstract and relevance of [FFT Audio Analysis]:
The FFT is another approach for solving the linear Discrete Fourier Transform, which
solves the signal's frequency spectrum. The DFT converts a list of equally spaced
samples of a function into a list of coefficients by summing up all of the sine waves.
In digital signal processing, the DFT function is any quantity or signal that varies
over time. These signals are sample over a finite time interval in a window function.
The FFT is a much faster calculation, since it is a log based algorithm. The FFT computes
the DFT of size N in O(N log N) operations.
